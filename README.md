# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this repository is to provide the assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

# Goals of the Repository

This repository contains one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Data for the Repository
The data for the project is found here: 

  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
  
This data must be downloaded to a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" in the working directory.
